I am a PhD student in the working group Atmospheric Dynamics, supervised by Andreas H. Fink and Michael Riemer External Link (JGU, Mainz). As a member of the Transregional Collaborative Research Center Waves to Weather External Link, I am working in project C3 (”Predictability of tropical and hybrid cyclones over the North Atlantic Ocean” External Link) on the development of statistical-dynamical models for intraseasonal predictions of tropical cyclone activity. The aim of this work is to investigate a broad range of meteorologically relevant predictors, and to compare different model types and architectures with respect to their performance and physical interpretability.
